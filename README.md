1. Retrieve the data from MovieLens dataset.
2. Apply the two matrix factorization algorithms non-negative matrix factorization. (Useing 
multiplicative update rule with 100 iterations, for nnmf choose 5, 10 features)
3. Predict the ratings for empty cells in the dataset.
4. Interpret the results above.
5. Compare the time and memory performance of nnmf method for MovieLens analysis 
considering above results.
6. Use the following reference for the project
